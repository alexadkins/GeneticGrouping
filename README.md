For use with Qualtrics exported questionnaire data.

### Preparing the Data:
- Mandatory column names: "name"
- Delete all but one header column. Rename header column values to desired fitness metrics. 
- Remove duplicates. 
- Add missing students. Look up and enter GPA. Fill in 0s for remaining values.

#### - Accounting for Partners: (optional)
- Under "primary_partner" column, put desired partner's full name so that it exactly matches the user's name in the data. 
- For "additional_partners", include other desired teammates separated by a colon (:). Do the same for "avoid_partners".
